### This is a code base written for one of my PhD projects - the idea was to do the following: 

## 1) take some monophonic recordings 
## 2) do some pitch-and-onset analysis on them
## 3) convert the results to text
## 4) train a recurrent neural network on the text data 
## 5) generate new streams of melodic information from the trained model 
## 6) notate the results
## 7) make music based on the generated notation
